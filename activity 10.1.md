Create a list m = [2, 4, 6, 8].

1. Print the second element in the list.
2. Create a new list fivem that has the elements 10, 20, 30, 40. Multiply m by 5 for this using a for loop, do NOT just create the list using fivem = [10, 20, 30, 40].
3. Add 10 to the list m and print m.
4. What happens if you add 6 to the list m? Do you get two 6â€™s or just one?
5. Print the position of 8 in m.
6. Delete 8 from m and print the new list.
